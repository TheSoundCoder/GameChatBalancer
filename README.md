# GameChatBalancer

GameChatBalancer is an opensource hordware audio balancer for Windows PCs. The functionality is inspired by the Chatmix function of some available headsets.

GameChatBalancer lets you use an Arduino (or similar boards) based knob or slider to balance the volume of chat-software and games so that you can easily
tune the audio volume while playing without any interruption by just turning a knob or moving a single slider.
